# ESP32Clock

This is a simple Program for the ESP32 Microcontroller with 4 5x5 Matrix LED Panels attached to display a Digital Clock.
The case and the frontplate are 3D printed. The case is made from Resin and the frontplate from thin white PLA.
Internal also features a coolingplate for the ESP32 which is kind of overkill.
The backside features a powerport and a button. The button resets the clock incase the clock freezes (what doesnt happen because my code is perfect)
The bottom has a second usb-c port which is for debugging and uploading code. While connected to that port the LED Matrix has to be turn off in order to not fry your USB port on your PC due to drawing to much amps.
